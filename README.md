Automated Data Analysis Tool
Overview
The Automated Data Analysis Tool is a Python-based solution designed to automate the analysis of datasets. The tool performs various statistical analyses, generates visualizations, detects outliers, and uses OpenAI's API to create a narrative summary of the data analysis. It provides a comprehensive report including summary statistics, data visualizations, and insights in an easy-to-understand format.

Features
Data Loading: Automatically loads datasets in CSV format.
Summary Statistics: Generates detailed summary statistics, including mean, median, standard deviation, and percentiles for numerical and categorical data.
Outliers Detection: Detects outliers in numerical columns using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
Correlation Matrix: Calculates and visualizes the correlation between numerical variables in the dataset.
Visualizations: Generates and saves various visualizations (pair plots, boxplots, and violin plots) to help understand the data.
Narrative Insights: Uses OpenAI’s models to generate human-readable narratives summarizing the key findings and trends from the dataset.
Reports: Saves all generated statistics, visualizations, and narratives in an organized output directory, including a README.md file.
How to Use
Step 1: Install Dependencies
Make sure you have the required Python libraries installed.

Step 2: Prepare the Dataset
Upload a dataset in CSV format.
The dataset should contain numerical and categorical columns for analysis.
Step 3: Set Up API Token
To generate the narrative insights, the tool uses OpenAI’s API. You will need to set up your API token.

Get your OpenAI API token from OpenAI.
Set the token as an environment variable.
Step 4: Run the Tool
Run the tool by specifying the path to your CSV file.

Step 5: Review the Results
After running the script, the tool will generate the following outputs:

A summary statistics table of all numerical columns.
A correlation matrix visualizing the relationships between numerical variables.
Visualizations: Pair plot, boxplot, and violin plot saved as PNG files.
A README.md file that contains:
A summary of the analysis, including statistics, missing values, and outliers.
Visualizations for outliers and data distribution.
A creative narrative generated by OpenAI summarizing the findings.
The analysis and visualizations are saved in a folder named after your CSV file.

Functionality
1. Data Analysis
The tool performs the following analysis steps:

Summary Statistics: Generates key statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max, and percentiles) for numerical columns.
Missing Values: Checks and reports any missing values in the dataset.
Correlation Matrix: Generates a heatmap of the correlation matrix to reveal relationships between numerical columns.
2. Outlier Detection
Using the IQR method, the tool detects outliers in numerical columns by comparing data points with the interquartile range (1.5 * IQR rule). Outliers are flagged and reported.

3. Data Visualization
Pairplot: Visualizes relationships between numerical features.
Boxplot: Displays box plots for each numerical feature to help identify outliers.
Violin Plot: Creates a violin plot for the first numerical column, showing its distribution.
4. Narrative Generation
The tool uses OpenAI's API to generate a creative narrative based on the analysis results, providing a detailed, human-readable summary of the data and its insights.

5. Reporting
The tool generates a README.md file with the following sections:

Introduction: Overview of the analysis.
Summary Statistics: Key statistical metrics for numerical columns.
Missing Values: Columns with missing data.
Outliers Detection: Information about detected outliers.
Correlation Matrix: Correlation matrix image.
Outlier Visualization: Boxplot showing outliers.
Distribution Plot: Violin plot of the first numerical column.
Narrative: A detailed story generated by the OpenAI model summarizing the analysis and providing insights.
Output Files
The generated output includes:

A folder named after your dataset (e.g., media.csv/).
README.md: A markdown file with the analysis results and generated narrative.
Visualizations: Images of the pair plot, boxplot, and violin plot.
